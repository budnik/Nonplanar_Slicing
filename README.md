# Nonplanar Gcode Transformation


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This project is the main part of the project work from Samuel Maissen and Severin Zürcher at ZHAW School of Engineering, Switzerland

Our main goal was to implement two different algorithm for producing non-planar GCode from planar slicing Software.
* Final GCode is created through transforming a .stl part to get a flat surface, slicing this transformed .stl and scale the planar Gcode in relation to the surface from the original part. With this algorithm, you get a GCode with different scaled layer heights throughout the same layer.
* Final GCode is created through turnig the part upside down, slice the part and pull the GCode to the buildplate, so that the original shape is recreated. 

Currently the ironing process works but still not perfect

### Built With

The implementation is completly based on Python 3.11, build with Visual Studio Code and sliced with Prusaslicer 2.7.0

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Make sure to have your favourite IDE with Python 3.11 and Prusaslicer 2.7.0 on your machine installed (preferably with Anaconda)


### Installation

To run this project you will need to install some python packages:
1. Numpy for calculation
```sh
pip install numpy==1.24.3
```
2. Scipy for further calculation
```sh
pip install scipy==1.11.1
```
3. DearPyGui for visualisation
```sh
pip install dearpygui==1.10.0
```
4. Shapely for Outline detection
```sh
pip install shapely==2.0.1
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Run main.py to open the GUI. 

Select your .stl file and the .ini config file (directly exported from Prusaslicer -> Ctrl + E)

Select the Path for your Prusaslicer.exe installation -> Standard path is predefined

Select the method you want to use:
* Method 1 adds a option to create an offset from the outline for rounded edges
* Method 2 adds the options to define the number of planar baselayers and the transformation method

Press "Calculate GCode" and wait for completion. For preview press "Open Nonplanar GCode"

Now you have your Non-planar GCode for printing.

### Tipps
* Check the maximal possible printing angle to avoid crashing your Z-Probe of Fan with the print
* It works stable with STL parts that have a flat baselayer and vertical sides.
* If method 2 takes too long, reduce the number of iteration and decrease the resolution of the z-Mesh
